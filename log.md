# 100 Days Of Code 🖥 - Shubham's Log 🙂

## Start Date ✍️

### Day 0️⃣: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)

**📌 Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**💡 Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**🔦 Link to work:** [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)
